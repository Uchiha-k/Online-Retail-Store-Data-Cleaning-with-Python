# Online Retail Store — Data Cleaning with Python
# Project Summary
This project automates the cleaning of messy Excel data from an online retail store. The goal was to transform raw, inconsistent sales data into a clean, analysis-ready format using Python. Tasks included removing blanks, flagging and dropping unwanted rows, formatting dates, and calculating revenue.
 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (raw input + cleaned output)
- VS Code + GitHub for version control

🔍 Cleaning Steps Covered
- ✅ Removed blank rows and columns
- ✅ Flagged and dropped unwanted entries (e.g., test rows, null transactions)
- ✅ Standardized date formats for consistency
- ✅ Calculated revenue using Quantity × UnitPrice
- ✅ Exported cleaned dataset to Excel for downstream analysis

  📁 Files Included
- Online Store.ipynb → Python notebook with cleaning logic and comments
- cleaned_online_retail.xlsx → Final cleaned dataset
- README.md → Project overview and documentation

💡 Why It Matters
Retail datasets are often messy and inconsistent. This project shows how a data analyst can:
- Automate repetitive cleaning tasks
- Build reusable logic for future datasets
- Prepare clean inputs for dashboards, forecasting, or customer segmentation
